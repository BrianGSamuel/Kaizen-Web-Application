# Enhanced Email Feature - Similar Kaizen Suggestions

## Overview

The Kaizen Web Application now includes an enhanced email notification system that automatically identifies and includes similar kaizen suggestions when engineers receive new kaizen submissions. This feature helps engineers make more informed decisions by providing context from previous similar suggestions.

## Features

### 1. Similar Suggestion Detection
- **Description Similarity**: Analyzes the suggestion description text to find common keywords and phrases
- **Cost Saving Type Matching**: Identifies suggestions with similar cost saving types (HasCostSaving/NoCostSaving)
- **Benefits Analysis**: Compares other benefits descriptions for similarity
- **Department-Specific**: Only shows suggestions from the same department as the receiving engineer

### 2. Enhanced Email Content
- **Original Kaizen Details**: Shows the new kaizen suggestion details
- **Similar Suggestions Section**: Displays up to 5 most similar previous suggestions
- **Rich Information**: Each similar suggestion includes:
  - Kaizen number and submission date
  - Employee name who submitted
  - Full description and benefits
  - Cost savings (if applicable)
  - Current approval status (Approved/Rejected/Pending)
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status indicators and emojis for better readability

### 3. Email Types Enhanced

#### Regular Kaizen Notifications
- Sent to engineers when a new kaizen is submitted in their department
- Includes similar suggestions from the same department
- Subject line: "New Kaizen Suggestion Submitted - {KaizenNo} (with Similar Suggestions)"

#### Inter-Department Notifications
- Sent to engineers in other departments when a kaizen is marked for inter-department implementation
- Includes similar suggestions from the target department
- Subject line: "Inter-Department Kaizen Suggestion - {KaizenNo} (with Similar Suggestions)"

## Technical Implementation

### New Service Methods

#### IKaizenService Interface
```csharp
Task<IEnumerable<KaizenForm>> GetSimilarKaizensAsync(
    string suggestionDescription, 
    string? costSavingType, 
    string? otherBenefits, 
    string department, 
    int currentKaizenId
);
```

#### IEmailService Interface
```csharp
Task<bool> SendKaizenNotificationWithSimilarSuggestionsAsync(
    string toEmail, 
    string kaizenNo, 
    string employeeName, 
    string department, 
    string suggestionDescription, 
    string websiteUrl, 
    IEnumerable<KaizenForm> similarKaizens
);

Task<bool> SendInterDepartmentNotificationWithSimilarSuggestionsAsync(
    string toEmail, 
    string kaizenNo, 
    string employeeName, 
    string sourceDepartment, 
    string targetDepartment, 
    string suggestionDescription, 
    string websiteUrl, 
    IEnumerable<KaizenForm> similarKaizens
);
```

### Similarity Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm to identify similar suggestions:

1. **Description Similarity (Weight: 2x)**: Counts common words between descriptions
2. **Cost Saving Type Match (Weight: 3x)**: Exact match on cost saving type
3. **Benefits Similarity (Weight: 1x)**: Counts common words in benefits
4. **Cost Saving Presence (Weight: 1x)**: Both suggestions have cost savings

**Minimum Score**: Suggestions must have a similarity score of at least 2 to be included.

### Email Template Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern HTML email design
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status badges with colors and icons
- **Helpful Tips**: Includes guidance on how to use the similar suggestions
- **Action Buttons**: Clear call-to-action buttons to review suggestions

## Benefits

### For Engineers
- **Better Context**: Understand how similar suggestions were handled
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends in successful vs. unsuccessful suggestions
- **Informed Decisions**: Make approval/rejection decisions based on historical data
- **Time Savings**: No need to manually search for similar suggestions

### For the Organization
- **Consistency**: Promotes consistent decision-making across similar suggestions
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Engineers learn from previous similar cases
- **Quality Improvement**: Better understanding of what makes suggestions successful
- **Efficiency**: Faster review process with relevant context provided

## Configuration

The feature is automatically enabled and requires no additional configuration. The system:

- Automatically finds similar suggestions when emails are sent
- Uses existing email settings and SMTP configuration
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing email functionality
- Logs similarity search results for monitoring and debugging

## Email Notification Logic

### Engineer Review Process
- **Engineer Approves**: Manager receives email notification with similar suggestions
- **Engineer Rejects**: No manager email notification is sent (process stops here)
- **Engineer Pending**: No manager email notification is sent

### Inter-Department Process
- **Engineer Approves + Marks for Inter-Department**: Engineers in target departments receive emails with similar suggestions
- **Engineer Rejects**: No inter-department emails are sent

## Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive logging:

- Similarity search initiation and results
- Number of similar suggestions found per department
- Email sending success/failure status
- Performance metrics for similarity calculations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML-based similarity detection
2. **Category Matching**: Include category-based similarity
3. **Implementation Status**: Show implementation status of similar suggestions
4. **Feedback Loop**: Allow engineers to rate similarity relevance
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by date ranges, approval status, etc.
