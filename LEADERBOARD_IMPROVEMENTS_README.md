# Leaderboard Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the Kaizen Leaderboard page to properly group kaizens by employee number and add visual recognition for the logged-in user.

## Key Features

### 1. Employee Number Grouping
- **Grouping Logic**: Kaizens are now properly grouped by `EmployeeNo` (employee number)
- **Aggregated Statistics**: Each employee shows their total kaizens, approved, pending, and rejected counts
- **Cost Savings**: Total cost savings are summed for each employee
- **Last Submission**: Shows the most recent kaizen submission date for each employee

### 2. Red Dot Recognition for Current User
- **Visual Indicator**: Red dot (ðŸ”´) appears next to the logged-in user's name
- **Row Highlighting**: The current user's row has a subtle red background and left border
- **Rank Badge Indicator**: "YOU" label appears on the rank badge for the current user
- **Animated Effects**: Red dot and indicators have a pulsing animation for attention

### 3. Enhanced Visual Design
- **Current User Styling**: 
  - Red background gradient for the current user's row
  - Red left border for easy identification
  - Enhanced hover effects with red shadow
- **Responsive Design**: All new elements work properly on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Tooltips and clear visual indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Controller Changes (`Controllers/KaizenController.cs`)
- Added current user identification using `GetCurrentUserAsync()`
- Pass current user's employee number to view via `ViewBag.CurrentUserEmployeeNo`
- Enhanced debugging output to track current user identification
- Maintained existing grouping logic by `EmployeeNo`

### View Changes (`Views/Home/Leaderboard.cshtml`)
- Added red dot (ðŸ”´) next to current user's name
- Added "YOU" indicator on rank badge for current user
- Enhanced CSS styling for current user row highlighting
- Added legend explaining the red dot indicator
- Improved responsive design for mobile devices

### CSS Enhancements
- `.current-user-row`: Styling for current user's employee info section
- `.current-user-dot`: Red dot styling with animation and hover effects
- `.current-user-indicator`: "YOU" label styling on rank badge
- `.current-user-tr`: Fallback styling for browsers without `:has()` support
- Enhanced hover effects and animations

## Data Structure

### LeaderboardViewModel
The existing `LeaderboardViewModel` already supports the required fields:
- `EmployeeNo`: Employee number for grouping
- `EmployeeName`: Employee name for display
- `TotalKaizens`: Count of all kaizens for the employee
- `ApprovedKaizens`: Count of approved kaizens
- `PendingKaizens`: Count of pending kaizens
- `RejectedKaizens`: Count of rejected kaizens
- `TotalCostSaving`: Sum of all cost savings
- `LastSubmission`: Most recent submission date

## Testing

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure test users exist in the database (see `insert_test_user.sql`)
2. Ensure test kaizen data exists (see `test_leaderboard_data.sql`)

### Test Scenarios
1. **Login as EMP001-User**:
   - Should see John Smith with 4 total kaizens
   - Red dot should appear next to "John Smith"
   - Row should have red highlighting
   - "YOU" indicator should appear on rank badge

2. **Login as EMP002-User**:
   - Should see Jane Doe with 5 total kaizens
   - Red dot should appear next to "Jane Doe"
   - Row should have red highlighting

3. **Login as SUP001-Supervisor**:
   - Should see Mike Johnson with 3 total kaizens
   - Red dot should appear next to "Mike Johnson"
   - Row should have red highlighting

### Expected Results
- Each employee should appear only once in the leaderboard
- Kaizen counts should be aggregated by employee number
- Current user should be clearly identified with red dot and highlighting
- Rankings should be based on total kaizens, approved kaizens, and cost savings

## Debugging
The enhanced logging will show:
- Current user information (username, employee number)
- Whether the current user is found in the leaderboard results
- Current user's rank in the leaderboard
- Detailed query information

## Files Modified
- `Controllers/KaizenController.cs` - Added current user identification
- `Views/Home/Leaderboard.cshtml` - Added red dot recognition and styling
- `test_leaderboard_data.sql` - Test data for verification
- `LEADERBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS_README.md` - This documentation

## Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for `:has()` selector and all features
- **Older Browsers**: Fallback styling using `.current-user-tr` class
- **Mobile Devices**: Responsive design with touch-friendly interactions

## Notes
- The grouping by employee number ensures fair ranking (no duplicate entries)
- Red dot recognition works for all user types (User, Manager, Engineer, etc.)
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Enhanced visual feedback helps users quickly identify their position
- All animations and effects are optimized for performance
